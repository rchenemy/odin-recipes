    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Four Seasons String Beans is one of my favorite dishes in Chinese cuisine. It contains a complex combination of flavors and spices, all brought together by the slight crunch of the string beans alongside the savoriness of ground beef and baby shrimp.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb green beans washed and trimmed to ~2" segments 四季豆，450克（折成两段）</li>
        <li>6 oz ground pork or ground beef 碎猪肉，170克</li>
        <li>8 cups water (for blanching) 2000毫升（用来焯水）</li>
        <li>2.5 tsp salt 食用盐，10克</li>
        <li>½ tsp Sichuan peppercorns 花椒，0.5茶勺</li>
        <li>2 medium hot green chilies sliced 辣椒，2根</li>
        <li>2 tsp ginger minced 姜末，2茶勺</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced 蒜末，3颗</li>
        <li>¼ tsp sugar 白糖，1克</li>
        <li>4 tsp cooking oil 菜油，20克</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp light soy sauce 生抽酱油，8克</li>
        <li>½ tsp Chinkiang (Chinese black) vinegar 镇江香醋，3克</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 8 cups of water and 2 tsp of salt to a rolling boil in the large pot. After the water boils, heat the stir fry pan on very low heat (200°F Duxtop induction 3.0)</li>
        <li>Blanch half the green beans in the salted water until bright green and 70% cooked (~90 seconds). Remove the green beans and drain well, and add to the stir fry pan. Repeat with the remaining green beans.</li>
        <li>Add 0.25 tsp of salt to the green beans, and optionally turn the heat up slightly to medium low (240°F induction 4.0). Cook the green beans, stirring occasionally, until blistered, crisp, and fully cooked (~10 minutes); set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up to medium (280°F induction 5.0) and 2 tsp of oil to the pan. When the oil comes to temp, add ground meat and 0.5 tsp light soy sauce to the pan. Break up the meat with the spatula, and cook until the meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics to the ground pork, and stir fry until fragrant and golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to medium-high (340°F induction 6.5), and add the remaining 2 tsp of oil. When the oil comes to temp, add the blistered green beans. Stir fry, tossing continuously, until the green beans are golden-brown and starting to shrivel in places.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, remaining 0.25 tsp of salt, and remaining 1 tsp light soy sauce, and keep tossing until fully absorbed, ~2 minutes. Add Chinese black vinegar around the side of the pan, and toss to combine.</li>
    </ol>
